takes a long time to understand it has collided.. .why?

thats why there is timeout

hypothesis 1 dueling can overcome the lack of detail in reward function (meh just thought)
------------------------------------------------------------
hypothesis 0 reward function in more detail has improved performance

hypothesis 1 
edit 1
judging collision should be modified to a longer distance from obstacle - collision doesn't get taken account of when there actually is

hypothesis 2 
edit 2
update target network missing - need to add this unless target network is updated only when an episode is over (target model should be updated every N number of timesteps regardless of whether episode is over or not

hypothesis 3 
edit3 
dueling can improve performance from double

hypothesis 4 lecun_uniform --> he_uniform
initialization method developed from lecun(LeNet) to Xavier to He

lecun --> glorot(xavier) 좀 더 최적화된, 층 간의 다른 노드의 수 계산에 사용

glorot(Xavier) --> He ReLU사용할 때 0으로 수렴하게 되는 현상이 있는데 이런 문제를 해결해주는 initialization
